# Q_trunc
To correct the illumination intensity of nephelometers in scattering efficiency calculation. Larger influences on bigger particles, e.g. dust.

Normalized illumination intensity RR903 from Fig. 2 in Muller et al., 2009

or normalized illumination intensity f_theta from Fig. 4 in Anderson et al., 1996

Bond et al., 2009 for total scattering
